*   **Date:** 2025-07-11
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Task
*   **Summary:** Overhauled the installation script and documentation for a better user experience.
*   **Details:**
    *   The `install.sh` script was completely rewritten to be interactive and user-friendly.
    *   It now uses the shared messaging utilities for consistent output.
    *   It correctly handles the installation of the `launchd` agent, giving the user a clear choice.
    *   The `com.pequet.dlssyncdrives.plist` was updated to use the global script path.
    *   The `README.md` was updated with clear, separate instructions for automated and manual setups.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The installation process is now much more professional, robust, and easier for users to understand, aligning with the project's goal of simplicity.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `install.sh`
    *   `assets/com.pequet.dlssyncdrives.plist`

*   **Date:** 2025-07-11
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Task
*   **Summary:** Refactored the main sync script to improve modularity and maintainability.
*   **Details:**
    *   The core `dls-sync-drives.sh` script was modified to source external utility scripts.
    *   Created `scripts/utils/logging_utils.sh` to handle all logging functions.
    *   Created `scripts/utils/messaging_utils.sh` to handle all user-facing terminal messages (headers, steps, etc.).
    *   Added `scripts/EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.txt` to show what the script's terminal output looks like.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The main script is now cleaner and focused on orchestration, while specialized functions are encapsulated in modules. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `scripts/dls-sync-drives.sh`

*   **Date:** 2025-07-10
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Task
*   **Summary:** Completed all project documentation and finalized the Memory Bank ahead of the public release.
*   **Details:**
    *   Wrote and reviewed all documents in the `memory-bank/` directory to ensure they accurately reflect the project's goals, architecture, and status.
    *   This completes the final documentation step before executing the pre-flight checklist.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The project is now fully documented, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for new users and future contributors.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `memory-bank/`

*   **Date:** 2025-07-09
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Milestone
*   **Summary:** Developed the installer script and `launchd` agent to fully automate the sync process.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created `install.sh` to handle file copying, permissions, and service loading.
    *   Created `assets/com.pequet.dlssyncdrives.plist` to define the scheduled task for `launchd`.
    *   This completes the core feature set for an automated "set and forget" utility.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The project is now a fully automated solution that a user can set up with a single command.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `install.sh`

*   **Date:** 2025-07-08
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Task
*   **Summary:** Developed the core backup script and externalized its configuration.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created the main `dls-sync-drives.sh` script using `rsync` to handle the file synchronization logic.
    *   Created the `sync.config.example` and established the pattern of using a `sync.config` file to allow users to easily define their source and destination directories without modifying the script itself.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The core logic of the backup utility is functional and configurable.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `scripts/dls-sync-drives.sh`

*   **Type:** Milestone
*   **Summary:** Project initialized from boilerplate and ready for customization.
*   **Details:**
    *   This is the first entry, automatically populated upon project initialization.
    *   The project structure and memory bank files were created by cloning the boilerplate.
    *   The next step is to review the `memory-bank/` files and customize them for this project's specific context.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   A clean, structured project environment is now in place.
    *   All boilerplate templates and AI rules are ready for user configuration.
