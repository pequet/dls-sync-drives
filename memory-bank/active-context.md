# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is finalizing the pre-flight routine before the initial public release on GitHub. This involves a final review of all components, documentation, and repository settings to ensure a quality release.

## Recent Changes
*   Completed the core feature set, including the sync script, installer, and `launchd` agent.
*   Refactored the main sync script (`dls-sync-drives.sh`) to use modular utility scripts for logging and messaging, improving maintainability.
*   Overhauled the `install.sh` script to be fully interactive, use shared messaging utilities, and correctly handle the automated installation of the `launchd` agent.
*   Updated the `README.md` to provide clear, separate instructions for both automated and manual installation.
*   Finalized all project documentation and memory bank files to ensure they accurately reflect the system's design and purpose.

## Next Steps

*   Execute the final pre-flight checklist.
*   Publish the repository to GitHub.
*   Announce the release and prepare to gather user feedback for future enhancements.
