# Development Status

## Overall Status
Describe the overall status of the project. What is the current state of development? What are the key features that are working, and what remains to be done?

*   The project is stable and feature-complete for its initial version (v1.0). The core functionality of automated, scheduled backups from cloud drives to a local directory is fully implemented and operational on macOS.

## What Works
List any features or components that are fully functional and working as expected.

*   **Core Sync Script:** `dls-sync-drives.sh` orchestrates the sync process, calling modular utilities for logging and messaging, and correctly uses `rsync` to mirror files.
*   **Configuration:** `sync.config` is successfully read by the script to allow user-defined source and destination paths.
*   **Installer:** `install.sh` provides a user-friendly, interactive process that properly copies all necessary files, sets permissions, and optionally loads the `launchd` service.
*   **Automation:** The `com.pequet.dlssyncdrives.plist` service runs the script automatically at the specified interval (every 2 hours).
*   **Utilities:** The logging and messaging utilities (`scripts/utils/`) provide centralized control over script output and logging.

## What's Left
List any remaining tasks or challenges the project is facing.

*   **Pre-flight Check:** Execute the final pre-flight checklist before the public release.
*   **Future Enhancements (Post v1.0):**
    *   Add more robust error handling (e.g., for when a destination drive is not connected).
    *   Expand the default `sync.config` to include more cloud services.
    *   Improve logging to provide a clearer history of sync operations.

## Issues
List any known issues or challenges the project is facing.

*   **Path Brittleness:** The hardcoded paths to cloud services in the default `sync.config` may not work for all users or future macOS versions, requiring manual user intervention.
